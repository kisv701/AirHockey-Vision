# AirHockey-Vision

This code is part of a bachelors degree project at Chalmers University.
The code uses the library OpenCV and analyses a video feed from a web camera connected to the computer.
The information in the video feed is used to detrmine the position of the puck on an air hockey table. 
When the position of the puck is found the program calculates a trajectory and sends positioncommands to an arduino program which
moves the mallet according to the calculations.
